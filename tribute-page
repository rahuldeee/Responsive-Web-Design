<blockquote cite="https://libquotes.com/jean-paul-sartre/quote/lbg4p7z">
  <p>You know how much I admire Che Guevara. In fact, I believe that the man was not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age: as a fighter and as a man, as a theoretician who was able to further the cause of revolution by drawing his theories from his personal experience in battle.
